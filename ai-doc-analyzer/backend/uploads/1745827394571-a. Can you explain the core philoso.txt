**a. Can you explain the core philosophy behind React?**

*   "React's core philosophy revolves around building user interfaces declaratively using reusable components. Instead of telling the computer *how* to update the UI step-by-step (imperative), you tell React *what* the UI should look like based on the current state (declarative). React then efficiently updates the actual DOM to match that desired state. Key principles include component-based architecture for reusability and separation of concerns, and the use of a Virtual DOM for performance optimization."

**b. How does React differ from other front-end frameworks you have worked with?**

*   *(Self-Correction: Be specific if you have experience, otherwise generalize)* "Compared to frameworks like Angular, React is primarily a library focused on the view layer. Angular is a more comprehensive framework, providing solutions for routing, state management, and dependency injection out-of-the-box. React gives you more flexibility to choose other libraries for these concerns (like React Router for routing or Redux/Context API for state management). Vue.js sits somewhere in between, offering an approachable, progressive framework. React's emphasis on one-way data flow and the Virtual DOM are also key differentiators compared to older approaches like direct DOM manipulation with jQuery or even some aspects of earlier frameworks."

**c. Describe the virtual DOM and its role in React.**

*   "The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is an in-memory representation, or a 'blueprint,' of the actual browser DOM. When a component's state changes, React first creates a new VDOM tree reflecting the updated UI. It then compares this new VDOM tree with the previous one using a diffing algorithm. This process, called 'reconciliation,' identifies the minimal set of changes needed. Finally, React updates *only* those specific parts of the real browser DOM, rather than re-rendering the entire thing. This makes updates significantly faster and more efficient, especially in complex applications."
