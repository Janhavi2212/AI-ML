**a. What is the difference between mounting and unmounting in the context of a React component's lifecycle?**

*   "**Mounting** is the process where a component instance is created and inserted into the DOM for the first time. This involves steps like calling the constructor (in class components), rendering the component, and React updating the actual DOM. The `componentDidMount` lifecycle method (in classes) or the `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array (`[]`) runs *after* the component is mounted.
*   **Unmounting** is the opposite: it's the process where a component instance is removed from the DOM. This typically happens when a component is conditionally rendered and the condition becomes false, or when navigating away from a view containing the component. The `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle method (in classes) or the *cleanup function* returned from a `useEffect` hook runs just *before* the component is unmounted. This is crucial for cleaning up resources like timers, subscriptions, or event listeners to prevent memory leaks."

**b. How does the useEffect hook differ from the lifecycle methods in class-based components?**

*   "The `useEffect` hook consolidates the functionality of several class lifecycle methods into a single API, but with a different mental model:
    1.  **Purpose Consolidation:** `useEffect` handles logic that previously required `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.
    2.  **Execution Timing:** By default, `useEffect` runs *after every render* (including the initial mount). Class lifecycle methods run at specific phases (mount, update, unmount).
    3.  **Control via Dependencies:** You control *when* `useEffect` re-runs by providing a dependency array.
        *   `[]` (empty array): Runs only once after the initial mount (like `componentDidMount`).
        *   `[dep1, dep2]`: Runs after the initial mount *and* anytime `dep1` or `dep2` changes (like `componentDidUpdate` but more targeted).
        *   No array: Runs after every render.
    4.  **Cleanup:** The cleanup function returned from `useEffect` handles the logic previously done in `componentWillUnmount`, but also runs before the effect runs again on subsequent renders (if dependencies change) to clean up from the *previous* effect execution. This helps prevent issues related to stale closures or resource leaks within the effect itself."
